# Creating The Checkout And Email Service

This page contains instruction for creating the checkout and email service. You're going to clone the sample repository and add functionality for checkout and email notification.

## Clone And Set Up The Repository

Fork the sample repository at [github.com/pmbanugo/ecomm-serverless-knative](https://github.com/pmbanugo/ecomm-serverless-knative), afterwards, clone your fork to your local dev environment. Open your terminal to the app directory and run `npm install`. That should install all the dependencies needed to run the project.

The project is a monorepo workspace with multiple Node.js projects and a Next.js frontend. The Node.js projects are functions that will be deployed to Knative and later consumed by the frontend application. The functionality for most of the functions have been implemented, except for `checkout` and `email` which you will implement.

> N.B If you don't want to write the code in this section, you can checkout the _02-complete_ branch, run `npm install` and move to the next section.

## Create an Upstash Account

You will use QStash to facilitate asynchronus messaging between services, and you need an account with Upstash for that. Go to [console.upstash.com](https://console.upstash.com/) and sign up for an account. When you're logged in, go to the [QStash](https://console.upstash.com/qstash) tab to find your **QSTASH_TOKEN**. Keep that tab open because you'll need that token for the exercise in this section.

## Create The Email Service

The email service is responsible for sending out emails whenever a customer places an order. In an ideal case, you will send out an email using some email service but we'll skip that finorder to reduce the amount of tools you need to set up. However, if you have a Sendgrid or Mailgun account and you'd like to use them, feel free to modify the code later.

### Add Code For The Email Service

The email service is located in the **func/email** directory. The service currently only returns a string that says `Welcome to Email Service`. Let's update the code to read the incoming POST request and log the message that'll likely be sent if we used an email service.

Open **func/email/index.js** and replace the existing code with the snippet below.

```javascript
const { createError, json } = require("micro");

const handler = async (req, res) => {
  if (req.url === "/health/liveness") {
    return "OK";
  }

  try {
    const {
      context: { email },
    } = await json(req);

    const message = {
      to: email,
      from: "peter@pmbanugo.me",
      subject: "Order Placed âœ”",
      html: "<p><b>Hello</b>!</p> <p>Your Order has been placed.</p>",
    };

    console.log(message);
    return "Email Sent";
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
    throw createError(500, "Unexpected server error");
  }
};

module.exports = handler;
```

The handler function is returned as the default export for the module. The first few lines return `OK` if the request path is `/health/liveness`. That path is used by Kubernetes and Knative to determine the health of the application.

The rest of the code extracts the email from the request payload and logs an email object to stdout.

> You can replace `peter@pmbanugo.me` on line 15 with whatever value you desire.

## Create The Checkout Service

The checkout service is responsible for checkout and sending a message to the email service. The messaging is done using QStash. The checkout flow is done in three different processes:

- add the shipping address.
- create the order.
- send a message to the queue.

The service is managed in **func/checkout** project. Open **func/checkout/index.js** and update the code in that file with the require statements below:

```javascript
const { createClient } = require("@urql/core");
const { createError, json } = require("micro");
const cors = require("./middleware/cors")({ allowMethods: ["POST", "PUT"] });
```

The `cors` middleware is used to enable CORS request to the service.

Next, add the following GraphQL mutation that will be used to update the commerce backend.

```javascript
const UPDATE_CHECKOUT_MUTATION = `
mutation UpdateCheckout($token: UUID!, $shippingAddress: AddressInput!) {
  checkoutShippingAddressUpdate(
    shippingAddress: $shippingAddress
    token: $token
    validationRules: { checkRequiredFields: false }
  ) {
    checkout {
      id
      email
    }
    errors {
      field
      message
      code
    }
  }

  checkoutBillingAddressUpdate(
    token: $token
    validationRules: { checkFieldsFormat: false, checkRequiredFields: false }
    billingAddress: $shippingAddress
  ) {
    checkout {
      id
    }
  }

  checkoutDeliveryMethodUpdate(token: $token, deliveryMethodId: "U2hpcHBpbmdNZXRob2Q6MTU=") {
    checkout {
      id
      token
    }
  }
}`;

const CREATE_ORDER_MUTATION = `
mutation CreateOrder($id: ID!) {
  orderCreateFromCheckout(
    id: $id
  ) {
    order {
      id
      isPaid
    }
  }
}`;
```

Afterwards, add the functions that will send the GraphQL requests to the commerce backend.

```javascript
async function updateAddress(client, { token, shippingAddress }) {
  result = await client
    .mutation(UPDATE_CHECKOUT_MUTATION, { token, shippingAddress })
    .toPromise();

  console.log("checkout result, ", JSON.stringify(result.data, null, 2));
  console.log("checkout error, ", JSON.stringify(result.error, null, 2));

  if (result.data.checkoutShippingAddressUpdate.errors?.length > 0) {
    console.log({
      GraphQLError: result.data.checkoutShippingAddressUpdate.errors,
    });
    throw createError(500, "Unable to add shipping address");
  }
  return result.data.checkoutShippingAddressUpdate.checkout;
}

async function createOrder(client, checkoutId) {
  console.log({ checkoutId });
  result = await client
    .mutation(CREATE_ORDER_MUTATION, { id: checkoutId })
    .toPromise();

  console.log("order result, ", JSON.stringify(result.data, null, 2));
  console.log("order error, ", JSON.stringify(result.error, null, 2));
  if (result.data.orderCreateFromCheckout?.errors?.length > 0) {
    console.log({
      GraphQLError: result.data.orderCreateFromCheckout.errors,
    });
    throw createError(500, "Unable to Create Order");
  }
  return result.data.orderCreateFromCheckout.order;
}
```

Both `updateAddress` and `createOrder` takes in a `client` parameter which is an instance of the _urql_ GraphQL client. The second parameter for these functions are the parameters that'll be set for the GraphQL requests they make.

We need a function to send a message to QStash. Since QStash can read HTTP requests, we will use the fetch API to send the message to QStash. They have a [JavaScript/TypeScript](https://github.com/upstash/sdk-qstash-ts) library if you choose not to create HTTP requests by yourself.

Add the function below to **index.js** for sending message to QStash:

```javascript
async function sendToQueue(email) {
  const emailService = "https://email.default.DOMAIN";
  await fetch(`https://qstash.upstash.io/v1/publish/${emailService}`, {
    body: JSON.stringify({ event: "order_created", context: { email } }),
    headers: {
      Authorization: "Bearer QSTASH_TOKEN",
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    method: "POST",
  });
}
```

Replace the **DOMAIN** keyword in the `emailService` variable with the DNS configuration for your Knative installation.

> If you followed the setup instruction for Civo, it should be your loadbalancer IP + `sslip.io`. For example `74.220.31.62.sslip.io`.

You should also replace the **QSTASH_TOKEN** with the value in Upstash console. Go to the [console.upstash.com/qstash](https://console.upstash.com/qstash) and copy your **QSTASH_TOKEN**.

![Upstash Console](../media/upstash-console.png)

The `sendToQueue` function sends a message with the format `{ event: "order_created", context: { email } }` to QStash. That message will be read and processed by the email service.

The final piece of the puzzle will be to implement the request handler function. Copy and add the code below to **index.js**:

```javascript
const handler = async (req, res) => {
  if (req.url === "/health/liveness") {
    return "OK";
  }

  try {
    const payload = await json(req);

    const client = createClient({
      url: "https://pmbanugo-dev.eu.saleor.cloud/graphql/",
    });
    client.fetchOptions = {
      headers: {
        Authorization: "Bearer SALEOR_CLOUD_APP_TOKEN",
      },
    };

    const { id, email } = await updateAddress(client, payload);
    const order = await createOrder(client, id);
    sendToQueue(email);
    return order;
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
    throw createError(500, "Unexpected server error");
  }
};

module.exports = cors(handler);
```

The handler function reads the request payload and uses that to update the shipping address and afterwards, creates the order. If those requests are successful, the `sendToQueue` functions is called. The commerce backend (Saleor Cloud) requires a special permission to process an order. That's why you have the authorization header in the GraphQL request. Replace the `SALEOR_CLOUD_APP_TOKEN` variable with the correct access token.

> The SALEOR_CLOUD_APP_TOKEN will be provided by the instructor during the workshop.

## Conclusion

You added code to process checkout to the `checkout` service, and an `email` service that sends email to the user when their order is created. In the next page, you'll deploy the functions and test out the application.
