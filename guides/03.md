# Deploy The Service And Integrate With The Storefront Application

This page will guide you on how to deploy the functions. The functions each have a _deploy_ script that can be used to deploy individual function. The root package.json file has a _deploy_ script as well, which uses Nx to run through the _deploy_ script for every function.

There are two variables you need to replace their values so that the deploy command will execute successfully.

1. **docker.io/pmbanugo**: This should be replaced with your container registry info. Search through the root directory and replace that value with your container registry namespace. For example, `docker.io/martin` if your Docker Hub username is **martin**.

2. **CLUSTER_EXTERNAL_IP**: This is your cluster public IP address. Search through the root directory and replace that value with your cluster's public IP.

You can find your Cluster's public IP from the Civo dashboard or using the command `kubectl --namespace contour-external get service envoy` if you're using Contour. For Istio, use `kubectl --namespace istio-system get service istio-ingressgateway`.

The _CLUSTER_EXTERNAL_IP_ variable is used in the frontend app and it makes up the URL for the functions you will deploy.
