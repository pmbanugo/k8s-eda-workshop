# Deploy The Service And Integrate With The Storefront Application

This page will guide you on how to deploy the functions. The functions each have a _deploy_ script that can be used to deploy individual functions. The root package.json file has a _deploy_ script as well, which uses Nx to run through the _deploy_ script for every function.

There are two variables you need to replace their values so that the deploy command will execute successfully.

1. **docker.io/pmbanugo**: This should be replaced with your container registry info. You will find that value in the **func.yaml** for every function in the _func_ directory. Search through the root directory and replace that value with your container registry namespace. For example, `docker.io/martin` if your Docker Hub username is **martin**.

2. **CLUSTER_EXTERNAL_IP**: This is your cluster public IP address and it's used by the app. Open the file **app/storefront/constant/url.ts**. Search and replace that value with your cluster's public IP.

You can find your Cluster's public IP from the Civo dashboard or using the command `kubectl --namespace contour-external get service envoy` if you're using Contour. For Istio, use `kubectl --namespace istio-system get service istio-ingressgateway`. The _CLUSTER_EXTERNAL_IP_ variable is used in the frontend app and it makes up the URL for the functions you will deploy.

## Deploy The Functions

Each function has a `deploy` script in its _package.json_ which calls `func deploy`. The root _package.json_ also has a `deploy` script which runs `nx run-many --target=deploy --all`. That `nx` command will run the `deploy` script for each project that has a _deploy_ script defined.

Let's deploy your functions now. Open the terminal and run the command `npm run deploy`. It will take a while for it to finish the first time you do this because the container images needed to build the project first need to be downloaded. Subsequent runs should be faster because they will pull from the local cache.

If the command successfully finishes, you can run the command `func list` to see the list of functions in your cluster and their URLs.

## Testing With The Storefront App

Now it's time to test the functions. You will use the web application which is included as part of the repository you cloned. Follow the instructions below to run the app:

- Open your terminal to the **app/storefront** directory.
- Run the command `npm install` to install the dependencies.
- Run the command `npm run dev` to start the application.

When the application starts, open http://localhost:3000 in your browser. Feel free to navigate around and use the hints below to guide you:

- The first thing you should do is to create a shopping session to store your cart items. To do that, click the **Sign In** button in the navigation bar at the top. The only thing required is your email ðŸ˜‰.
- The Home page has no useful data. Select a category at the top to see products and add items to the cart.
- To ensure a successful checkout, select *USA* as the country. You can use the data in the screenshot below as an example. This is required because the commerce backend is set up to fail any checkout request if there's no stock available in the selected region/country.
