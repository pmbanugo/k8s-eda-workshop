# Start

This workshop guide is designed for learning _how to build event-driven, serverless functions in Kubernetes_. The following are required from you before joining the workshop:

- Knowledge of cloud computing and building cloud-native apps/service.
- Basic understanding and familiarity with patterns like serverless functions or event-driven architecture.
- Basic familiarity with Kubernetes.
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript (because the examples are in JavaScript).

JavaScript knowledge is not strictly required because the code snippet will be briefly explained, and the concept can be applied to other popular programming languages. In the last section of the workshop, you'd get to build something from your imagination and use whatever programming language you prefer.

You would need the following tools installed to code along in the workshop.

- Node.js [v18.x](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/) and above.
- A Kubernetes cluster.
- [Knative](https://knative.dev/docs/install/yaml-install/serving/install-serving-with-yaml/) installed and configured on your k8s cluster.
- The **kn** and **func** CLI to interact with Knative from the terminal.
- Docker: Either as via Docker Desktop or Rancher Desktop. Make sure to be logged in to your container registry e.g Docker Hub.

Follow the instruction in the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/) installation page to install Node.js. I provided set-up instructions for setting up Kubernetes and Knative below.

## Set Up A Kubernetes Cluster

You can use a local cluster using Kind, Docker Desktop, or Rancher Desktop. For this workshop, I'll provide instructions for working with Kubernetes on [Civo](civo.com) Cloud, and point you to a different resource where you can find instructions to set up locally.

### Set Up Local Cluster With Knative

You can also use a local cluster using minikube, [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/), or Docker Desktop.

For kind, follow the instructions at [konk.dev](https://github.com/csantanapr/knative-kind). Actually it's just a single command `curl -sL get.konk.dev | bash` that will do it for you.

For minikube, follow the instructions at [github.com/csantanapr/knative-minikube](https://github.com/csantanapr/knative-minikube).

For Docker Desktop, follow the instructions at [github.com/csantanapr/knative-docker-desktop](https://github.com/csantanapr/knative-docker-desktop)

### Set Up A Civo Kubernetes Cluster With Knative

Civo cloud gives new users free $250 credit for a month. All you need to do is register and put a Credit/Debit card and wait a few minutes for your account to be activated. You can delete your account or the cluster after the workshop.

To follow these set-up instructions, pls make sure you have the following CLI tools installed:

- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl)
- [Civo CLI](https://github.com/civo/cli#set-up)

> The links should take you to the installation page.

You need a Civo account to create a Civo Kubernetes cluster. If you don't have one, go to [dashboard.civo.com/signup](https://dashboard.civo.com/signup). After you're registered, follow the instruction below to set up the CLI and create a k8s cluster.

1. Add your API Key to the Civo CLI using the command `civo apikey save <Name for your API Key> <API key>`. You can find your API key on Civo dashboard by going to [**Account > Settings > Security**](https://dashboard.civo.com/security).

2. Ensure that the Civo CLI is using the correct API key by running the command `civo apikey current <Name for your API Key>`.

3. Create the cluster using the command `civo kubernetes create workshop-cluster --size "g4s.kube.medium" --nodes 2 --wait --save --merge --region FRA1 --switch -r Traefik-v2-nodeport`

> Did you notice how fast that was? ðŸ”¥

#### Set Up Knative On Civo Cloud

I've prepared a couple of bash scripts that you can use to install and configure Knative in your cluster. Open your terminal and run the following commands:

1. Installing Knative serving using the command `curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pmbanugo/k8s-eda-workshop/main/scripts/01-serving.sh | sh`.

2. Install and configure Contour as the networking layer using the command `curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pmbanugo/k8s-eda-workshop/main/scripts/02-contour.sh | sh`.

3. Configure additional extensions such as automatic TLS provisioning for Knative services `curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pmbanugo/k8s-eda-workshop/main/scripts/03-serving-extensions.sh | sh`

## Install _kn_ and _func_ CLIs

The _kn_ CLI provides a quick and easy interface for creating Knative resources such as services and event sources, without the need to create or modify YAML files directly. It also simplifies the completion of otherwise complex procedures such as autoscaling and traffic splitting. _func_ on the other hand is used to create, build, manage and deploy functions.

Run the commands below to install both kn and func.

```bash
brew tap knative-sandbox/kn-plugins
brew install knative/client/kn
brew install func
```
